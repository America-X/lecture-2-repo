# lecture-2-repo

This is lecture number 2.

Why would we want to have a local verison of the repo?
    We would want a local verison because 
        1. we can have offline modifction before we publish it
        2. Incase we mess up, it won't affect the actually code. It does not affect the remote version. 

What are the steps after making any change to your first repo?
1. You woukd have to check the status of your repo. using git status 
2. to update what will be committed, we use git add (.) or (-A) 
3. we then check git status again to make sure we updated it
4. after we do (git commit -m "message") 
Finally we (git push) so it will show in github. 

this content is hard but I am sure we got this.
